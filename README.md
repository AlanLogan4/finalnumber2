# Intro-to-web-Final-Project
Proposal:
 What I would like to do for my final project is a more complete online store. It will me some similar to the other that we did but with some extra features. There will be a check out page so that you can actually "buy" the items. There will also be a page so that you can re-stock the items in the website which you can only acces by login in as an admin.
 I will host my website both in a GitHub Page and a non github page and I will host my back-end api on a server. I really would like to do this since I feel is something cool and something that will really challenge my abilities. To be honest I hope that this isn't a lot more complicated than what I expect but I would love to see it working. Another thing that I would add would be both a search bar and a filter for the items.
 The api will hold the information of the items in a jason string and then the informatio of the items including the amont will the stored in the local storage. The re-stock page will only load if the user entered the username and password correctly, when it sends the form of both of these and they are correct a variable will be set to true and the page will only load of that variale is equal to true.
